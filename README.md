# Dominant_colors
Identify the dominant color from image

I have used K-Means clustering to get 5 dominating colors from the image and histogram to get the percentage of domination and visualization.
Overall I have used OpenCV with KMeans for the whole project. The output of the python file contains the top 5 dominating colors with their hexcode and percentage sharing and a histogram to visualize real color(as we can't really visualize color by it's hexcode).
